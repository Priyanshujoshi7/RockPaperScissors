Rock, Paper, Scissors Game
This is a simple Rock, Paper, Scissors game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
The project was created to practice and enhance my skills in DOM manipulation.

Features
Interactive Gameplay: Play the classic Rock, Paper, Scissors game against the computer.
Score Tracking: The game keeps track of the player's and computer's scores.
Winner Announcement: After each round, the game announces the winner or if it's a draw.
Game Reset: Easily reset the game to start a new match.
Responsive Design: The game is styled using CSS and is responsive for various screen sizes.
How It Works
Select Rock, Paper, or Scissors to play a round.
The computer randomly selects its choice.
The winner of the round is determined based on traditional rules:
Rock beats Scissors
Scissors beats Paper
Paper beats Rock
The first to reach a certain score wins the game.
You can reset the game at any time to play again.
Learning Outcomes
This project helped me improve my understanding of:

DOM Manipulation: Handling user interactions and updating the UI dynamically.
JavaScript Logic: Implementing game logic and randomization.
Responsive Design: Using CSS to ensure the game looks good on various devices.
